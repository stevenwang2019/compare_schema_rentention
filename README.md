`python info-worker.py` for running multi-threaded


`nohup python info_worker.py & ` for running the task in the background. Also consider use >/dev/null 2>&1 so it would not generate a massive nohut.txt file.

Make a summary of the diff txt file. The 1st arg is the path to the txt file. 2nd and 3rd args are the index of the array generated by delimiting the wsp file path. Below two commands are equivalent.
`python analyze_diff_txt.py > summary.txt`
`python analyze_diff_txt.py diff/diff.txt 4 8 > summary.txt`
